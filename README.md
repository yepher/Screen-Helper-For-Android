Screen-Helper-For-Android
=========================

On some Android devices [like the Samsung Galaxy S3] there is no setting to keep the screen on while it is connected to power.

This can be especially painful if you are debugging on the device. This is a very simple utility that will keep the screen on if the following two conditions are met:
    1. Screen-Helper is running in the background
    2. The device is connected to a USB, AC

The primary logic is taken from this blog post:
